Added login page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/
Added logout page at http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/logout/
Users can only add or delete tasks when logged in. The main page is public.
Added field to Task model for owner. Should automatically fill in with the current user when creating a new instance, but doesn't.
Added url and view for a user detail page, which should show all of the user's tasks. Doesn't work yet.
